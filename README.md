# Hyphal

## Setup

```
yarn install
```

### ENVVARS

You can override chain id, some of the contracts' addresses, or firebase credentials (if you want to use your own bucket).
If you wish to do so, refer to `src/config/index.ts` to find the vars names.
Normally, you don't need to explicitly set any of env vars.

```
yarn start
```
