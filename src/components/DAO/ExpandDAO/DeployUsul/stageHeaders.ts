        or Gitcoin, with a proposal core that can register swappable voting contracts. This
        enables DAOs to choose from various on-chain voting methods that best suit their needs.
		
		Determine which voting strateg(ies) best fit your DAOâ€™s decision-making process, set up
		the required parameters to each, and add the strateg(ies) to the deployment queue. You
		can add as many as you would like. Once you have finished, proceed to the next step to
		confirm your transactions and deploy.`
